# Introduction
The objective of this document is to explain how I have reached to the final solution (my personal website), explaining my ideas and solutions that I found when doing the website. The website is composed by an index.html, which derives all of the next web pages, which are: about.html, contact.html, degree.html, fce.html, net.html and topic.html. It's important to notice that the fce.html is included inside the degree.html, in other words, the only way to reach the fce.html is by being first in the degree.html.



# Description 
As I have explained before, the objective was to create a personal website, with this, it makes me learn how to use css, html. I think it is a different way of learning, not just by studying slides. The about page talks about me, my personal info. My studies, what I like to do in my free time, it includes relevant images about me and two links to my social media (instagram and github). The contact page is basically a contact page where you enter your name, your email and the message you want to send me. This makes  the communication be fluent, if there is any error or mistake in the webpage. The degree page mentions all the subjects that I have, they are divided in years and category. The fce page is a specialized page for the subject of fundamental Engineering, it mentions what is the objective of the subject, the units that have been seen and the practical works made. The net page includes four different links to the websites of my peers. In the topic page there is detailed information about Artificial Intelligence, it includes relevant photos and other links with extra info if someone needs more info.


# Problems 

While doing the website I encoutered lots of challenges and I'm going to explain some of them. One of the problems that were more basic was that I placed wrongly the file, for example storing the images in the wrong directory or placing the different web pages outside the folder "public". Another mistake that I did was to use incorrect relative paths to link to css. When doing the website, I made lots of technical web development errors, such as placing <div> inside of the paragraph tags (<p>). Or just by using lots of <div > tags is an error, as there has to be proper segmantic tags. I had also some problems with the links that linked to the websites of my peers, as when it was clicked it says that there was no webpage.


# Conclusions

In conclusion, I think that this practical work makes us familiarize with all of the css and html content, but in a good way, as is by creating a webpage which is more practical and better that only studing slides. The objective was to create a website but you could talk about lots of things, it was very easy to find a way to like this practical work. I liked this practical as you study css and html in a more practical way, which is much more entertaining that just studying slides.
